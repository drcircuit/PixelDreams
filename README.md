# Pixel Dreams
This is a little "framework" to create demo scene effects using Unity. It sets up a pixel shader projected onto a camera aligned quad. This is similar to ShaderToy.
I have included some effects from the demo Pixel Dreams I use in my talk about the demo scene at conferences. The license is Creative Commons, please use as you like, and keep on creative coding!
